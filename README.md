# Body: near and far
Swedish title: "Nära och långt från kroppen"

An experimental, living poetry piece that explores the body, it's borders and transitions. Released as part of the [fourth edition](https://kontradiktion.fi/#4) of [Kontradiktion](https://kontradiktion.fi/), a digital publication for experimental, multimedia and online poetry.

The project is available on [kontradiktion.fi/body](https://kontradiktion.fi/body) and [palmdrop.github.io/body](https://palmdrop.github.io/body).

# Process
The piece consist of three main poems, each exploring different aspects of the body, it's surroundings, and anxiety, from a personal perspective. Each line in all three poems have been "tagged" with words corresponding to the contents or thoughts behind the line. The frontend interface of the project tries to find lines that somehow "match" each other, and presents them in a central square. These three lines creates a thematic group. The single word at the bottom right corner detached from these tags. The word is instead controlled by a hidden association loop of words.

[Goo Poem](https://palmdrop.github.io/goo-poem) is a predecessor of the project. "Body: near and far" builds on similar poetic and technical methods. Look here for the [goo poem repository.](https://github.com/palmdrop/goo-poem)
